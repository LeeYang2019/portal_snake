# portal_snake

## Description

In this programming assignment, I implemented the game Portal Snake. This game combines elements from the classic game of Snake (aka Nibble) with the modern puzzle game Portal. In this game, the user maneuvers a snake to collect apples that extend the length of its body. The user wins by collecting all of the apples on a given level. However colliding with any rocks or with your own body will end your game with a loss. The twist on this classic Snake gameplay, is that levels also contain pairs of portals (blue and orange) that teleport your snake from one part of the screen to another.

## Goals

## The following are what I learned from the project:

        Learn to instantiate and use methods from provided classes based on their documentation.
        Understand the difference between static and non-static class methods.
        Organize your own code into classes for modularity and code re-usability.
        Become more familiar with the architecture of real-time simulations and games.
        Gain experience using ArrayList collections of different object types.
        Create a basic computer game that can be expanded with many fun new features.
